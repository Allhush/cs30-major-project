# Alliam Hushagen - Reflection on cs30 major project

## What advice would you give to yourself if you were to start a project like this again?
I would tell myself not to fixate on code that isn't working, trying to fix it and instead switch to using the newer and beeter code I was working on. I also would have told myself to leave some of the minor bugs alone so that I could continue working on the bigger things to save time and bug fixing for later. Lastly I would have advised just adding extra variables to the basic classes rather than creating entirely new classes for each new thing(EX. What I did to get the mutated boss)

## What was the hardest part of the project?
Definitely the targeting system, I ended up using it in all but the healer characters, the enemies use it to find the troops and the troops use it to hit the enemies. Originally the system was very buggy and would cause the code to break all the time, and I had to spend 2+ weeks fixing until finally I changed several variables and detection systems around until it would work normally. Then I had to make more edits so that it would work with moving troops around and wouln't break when they were moved. 

## did you complete everything in your “needs to have” list?
Yes! I managed to complete everything on the "needs to have" list, this consisting of 
- Money collected from enemies to buy troops
- multiple troop types with different attacks
- multiple enemy types with different attacks
- Waves that become more difficult over time
- at least 1 boss monster
- ability to move troops to desired areas
- sound effects
I also managed to complete some of my "nice to have" list such as 
- endless mode
- multiple boss monsters
- even more troops
    - healer

## Were there any problems you could not solve?
Yes, originally I wanted the skeletons to also target spear and healer troops over the regular sword troops as well as being faster and stronger. I tried to get them to target
